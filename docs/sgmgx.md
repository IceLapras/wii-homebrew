# SaveGame Manager GX

SaveGame Manager GX is a homebrew app that lets you extract (back up) and install save files from or to your Wii.

!> The application may not work if you haven't installed [cIOS](https://wii.skyybrew.xyz/#/cIOS)

## Let's now install this software.

### You will need:
 * An SD card formatted to FAT32
 * A Wii
 * [SaveGame Manager GX](https://hbb1.oscwii.org/api/v3/contents/SaveGame_Manager_GX/SaveGame_Manager_GX.zip)

### How to run it
2. Copy the ```apps``` folder from the ```.zip``` you downloaded, and copy it onto the root of your SD card.
3. Open the Homebrew Channel and launch SaveGame Manager GX from the list of homebrew

### Installing save files

1. Place your save files on the ```savegames``` folder on the root of your SD/USB (create one if you don't have it)
2. Open SaveGame Manager GX.
3. Identify the save file, then click on it.
4. Press install.

!> To install a save file, you need another one already on your Wii.

### Exporting save files

1. Identify and click the save file.
2. Either click copy or move, depending on what you want to do.

?> SaveGame Manager lets you copy over save files with copy protection (that normally can't be copied nor moved).

!> If the install button doesn't show up, you either don't have a save file of the same game on the Wii or it might be a cIOS related problem.
